# TestSync
An experiment for syncing an internal and an external Git repostory

I was asked to reserach a way to keep to Git repositories in sync. One in
GitHub and one in Azure DevOps.  Both repositories can accept pull requests.


Settings for this repo include
* Allow anyone to contribute (not just collaborators)
* Require pull requests
